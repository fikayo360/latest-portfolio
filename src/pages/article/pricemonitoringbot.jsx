                In an era of dynamic pricing, staying updated on price changes is crucial for businesses and consumers alike. Whether itâ€™s for tracking competitor prices,
                monitoring product deals, or alerting users about price drops, a price monitoring bot can be a game-changer. 
                In the fast-paced world of online shopping, staying updated with price fluctuations can be a game-changer for businesses and consumers alike. 
                To address this need, we built a price monitoring bot using Node.js and Puppeteer,
                capable of tracking prices on e-commerce websites and notifying users of changes. Here's a breakdown of how i built the bot and its benefits.

                <p>A price monitoring bot is a software application that automatically scrapes product prices from websites at regular intervals. It can:</p>
                <ul className='mb2'>
                    <li>Track prices on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay.</li>
                    <li>Alert users when prices drop below a specific threshold.</li>
                    <li>Compare prices across multiple platforms</li>
                    <li>Generate detailed report for analysis</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Tools and technoogies used</h1>
                <img src='https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*3IP3aaxZK40PH8Wsfjq7JA.png' className='.articleImg articleContentMargin' />
                <ul className='mb2'>
                    <li>Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable applications.</li>
                    <li>Puppeteer: A headless browser automation library for scraping dynamic content.</li>
                    <li>Nodemailer: For sending email alerts.</li>
                    <li>MongoDB: For storing product and price data.</li>
                    <li>dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Step by step implementation</h1>
                <h1>We started by outlining the problem the bot would solve The main goals were:</h1>

                <h1>Setting Up the Development Environment</h1>
                <img src="/monitor1.png" className='.articleImg articleContentMargin' />
                <p className='mb2'>We chose Node.js as our backend technology for its scalability and event-driven architecture.
                   Puppeteer, a powerful browser automation library, was used for web scraping due to its ability to simulate real user interactions in a browser environment.
                </p>

                <h1>Identifying Target Websites</h1>
                <img src='https://e8wm23is9ki.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-26-at-16.19.38.png?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1' className='.articleImg articleContentMargin' />
                <p className='mb2'>We selected a list of e-commerce websites to monitor. Each website required understanding its structure, 
                such as product pages and pricing elements, to extract the required data accurately.</p>

                <h1>Building the Scraper </h1>
                <h1>we implemented the following steps</h1>
                <img src="/monitor3.png" className='.articleImg articleContentMargin' />
                <ul className='mb2'>
                    <li>Launched a headless browser instance using Puppeteer.</li>
                    <li>Navigated to product pages programmatically.</li>
                    <li>Located and extracted product details using CSS selectors.</li>
                    <li>Ensured dynamic content was fully loaded before extraction, adding necessary delays.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1> Storing and Tracking Price Data</h1>
                <p className='mb2'>We used a database to store product details and their prices over time. This allowed us to track historical data and identify trends.</p>

                <h1>Adding Alerts and Notifications</h1>
                <img src="/monitor2.png" className='.articleImg articleContentMargin' />
                <p className='mb2'>To notify users of price changes, we integrated email alerts. The bot compared current prices with the stored
                 values and sent an alert when a significant change was detected.</p>
